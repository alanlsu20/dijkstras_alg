Basic implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest path between two points. Grid class written to create a series of nodes joined with edges of a certain length, also can read in a .txt file of a specified format. Once the grid is built, it can be inputted into the dijkstra function that recursively finds the shortest path to each node from a starting node. This program then prints paths based on an input of the destination node and an optional parameter of any nodes you wish to specifically avoid. test(), test2(), test3(), and test4() functions are included for demonstration. Visual representation of test2() grid is included as Example2 Diagram.jpeg. test3() and test4() read .txt files grid1.txt and grid2.txt, respectively.
