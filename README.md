Math260 Final Project

Basic implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest path between two points. Grid class written to create a series of nodes joined with edges of a certain length. Once the grid is built, it can be inputted into the dijkstra function that recursively finds the shortest path to each node from a starting node. This program then prints paths based on an input of the destination node. test() and test2() functions are included for demonstration. Visual representation of test2() grid is included as Example2 Diagram.jpeg.
