In this .txt file we should write up the discussion of our project:


From the project document:
The discussion (graded): Say something about your work.
• Write your document in LaTeX. (I’ll post templates that include formatting python
code and math -just the bare minimum is needed here; learning TeX a low priority).
• Description: Give an informal discussion of your code - how it works, how you
organized the code, and and the main computational challenges (what is notable about
it?). This is not formal documentation; just a chance for you to share what you’ve
done. You can include a bit of the necessary mathematical context, but this is not a
focus.
• Discussion: Discuss your results - analyze the output of your code applied to some
problem. The amount to discuss depends on the project; you may find there is more
to say on the computational side whereas other projects are more about exploring an
application. What interesting features have you identified?


From piazza:
As a reminder, you should write a brief discussion of your project 
(see part C of the project description). This should be a file in your repository. 
Think of it as a sort of brief tour of your problem and and interesting features for the 
viewer of your code.

It doesn't have toi be long, but I do expect there to be something. What you 
point out will help me to be able to give you credit for your work 
(you are, in a sense, defining what you've done).

I noted that it should be written in LaTeX - this is not a requirement as 
previously stated. It's probably easiest to use latex if you have math to 
format, but you are likely writing mostly text and code. You can refer to code 
in your discussion (e.g. code example functions), and let those examples help 
to illustrate your points.
